Model Meta Options
==================

When defining a class, you can do more than just give it a name. By
defining a class named ``Meta`` within a model, you can control several
aspects of its behavior. Any options that are omitted will be given
their default values, as show below.

.. code-block:: python

    class User(Model):
        class Meta:
            auto_timestamp = True
            collection = 'users'
            database = 'default'
            field_map = {'id': '_id'}
            map_id = True
            safe = True
            sort = None
            typed_fields = {'id': ObjectId}
            w = 1


.. _auto_timestamp:

``auto_timestamp``
------------------

By default, calling :meth:`~simon.Model.save` will cause the ``created``
and ``modified`` fields to update accordingly. Adding
``auto_timestamp = False`` to the ``Meta`` class will disable this
behavior.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        auto_timestamp = False  # do not automatically add timestamps


.. _collection:

``collection``
--------------

By default, the collection associated with a model will be the name of
the model with an ``s`` appended to it. Adding ``collection`` to the
``Meta`` class will allow its value to altered.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        collection = 'simon'  # store documents in the simon collection


.. _database:

``database``
------------

By default, all collections will be located in the default database. If
you use the :meth:`~simon.connection.connect` method to connect to
additional databases, the database to use with a model can be controlled
by adding the ``database`` option to the ``Meta`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    connect('localhost', name='logs', alias='logs')

    class Meta:
        database = 'logs'  # use the logs database


.. _field_map:
.. _map_id:

``field_map`` and ``map_id``
----------------------------

By default, the ``_id`` field of all models is exposed through the
``id`` attribute. Additional fields can be added to the mapping by
including them in the ``field_map`` dictionary. The keys of the
dictionary represent attribute names and the values represent the keys
used in the document.

When the ``map_id`` option is ``True`` (the default), you can define a
custom mapping without having to include ``'id': '_id'``. It will be
added for you.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        # map friends to list_of_friends
        field_map = {'list_of_friends': 'friends'}
        map_id = False  # do not map _id to id

You can also use ``field_map`` to expose nested fields as top-level
attributes.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        field_map = {'x': 'location.x', 'y': 'location.y'}

Why would you want to use this behavior? Unlike a relational database
which stores its schema at the table level, MongoDB's dynamic schema
requires key names to be stored as part of each document. The longer the
names of your keys, the more storage space you will need (keep in mind
this is only really a problem with extremely large collections). When
using shortened key names, it may make the names harder to remember,
resulting in code that is harder to read and maintain. By utilizing
``field_map``, more meaningful names can be used in code while storing
shorter variations in the database.

.. code-block:: python

    class User(Model):
        class Meta:
            field_map = {
                'first_name': 'fname',
                'last_name': 'lname',
                'location': 'loc',
            }

    user = User.create(first_name='Simon', last_name='Seville',
                       location='Fresno, CA')

This query executing in the mongo Shell would look a little different:

.. code-block:: javascript

    db.users.insert({fname: 'Simon', lname: 'Seville', loc: 'Fresno, CA'})


.. _required_fields:

``required_fields``
-------------------

While Simon tries to expose MongoDB's dynamic schema by not enforcing a
schema on a model, there may be times when you wish to make sure that a
document contains certain fields before it is saved. You can designate a
field as required by adding it to the ``required_fields`` option in the
``Meta`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        required_fields = 'email'

With this setting, you wouldn't be able to save a document unless it
contained an ``email`` field.

You can also require multiple fields.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        required_fields = ('email', 'name')

If you try to save a document that is missing any of the required
fields, :class:`TypeError` will be raised.


.. _safe:

``safe``
--------

**DEPRECATED** If using PyMongo 2.4 or newer, the ``safe`` option has
been deprecated. Use :ref:`w` instead.

With the introduction of
:class:`MongoClient <pymongo:pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient>`, updates
are performed with write concern enabled by default. To revert
to the previous behavior seen in versions of PyMongo prior to 2.4, set
the ``safe`` option to ``False``. When write concern is disabled at the
model level, it can still be used on a case by case basis by providing
``safe=True`` as a parameter to method calls.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        safe = False  # don't use write concern for this model by default

More information about write concern is available in the
`MongoDB Docs <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-operations/#write-concern>`_.


.. _sort:

``sort``
--------

By default, calls to :meth:`~simon.Model.all` and
:meth:`~simon.Model.find` will use natural order for sorting. If you
want to have a model default to a different sort order, you can do so
by defining the ``sort`` option in the ``Meta`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        sort = 'name'  # sort by name ascending

The default sort can also handle multiple fields.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        sort = ('name', 'email')  # sort by name and email ascending

For a explanation of how to take full advantage of the ``sort`` option,
check out the :meth:`~simon.query.QuerySet.sort` method.

More information about natural sort is available in the
`MongoDB Docs <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-natural-order>`_.


.. _typed_fields:

``typed_fields``
----------------

While Simon tries to expose MongoDB's dynamic schema by not enforcing a
schema on a model, there may be times when you wish to make sure that a
field is of a certain type before it is saved. You can designate a
field as typed by adding it to the ``typed_fields`` option in the
``Meta`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        typed_fields = {'email': basestring}

With this setting, you wouldn't be able to save a document if its
``email`` field contained a value that wasn't a string.

If addition to being any valid type, a field can be specified as a typed
list.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        typed_fields = {'tags': [basestring]}

This will type the ``tags`` field as a list of strings. You wouldn't be
able to save a document if its ``tags`` field contained anything other
than a list whose values were all strings.

If you try to save a document with a field that is of the wrong type,
:class:`TypeError` will be raised.

.. warning::
   When setting ``_id`` to a type other than
   :class:`ObjectId <pymongo:bson.objectid.ObjectId>`, failing to
   explicitly provide a value for ``_id`` will result in the database
   automatically assigning an
   :class:`ObjectId <pymongo:bson.objectid.ObjectId>`.

.. warning::
   When setting ``_id`` to a type other than
   :class:`ObjectId <pymongo:bson.objectid.ObjectId>`, it will be
   possible to overwrite a document in the database if the value of
   ``_id`` isn't first checked for uniqueness.


.. _w:

``w``
-----

With the introduction of
:class:`MongoClient <pymongo:pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient>`, updates
are performed with write concern enabled by default. To revert
to the previous behavior seen in versions of PyMongo prior to 2.4, set
the ``w`` option to ``0``. When write concern is disabled at the
model level, it can still be used on a case by case basis by providing
``safe=True`` as a parameter to method calls.

.. code-block:: python

    class Meta:
        w = 0  # don't use write concern for this model by default

More information about write concern is available in the
`MongoDB Docs <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/write-operations/#write-concern>`_.
